# Mars_News-Scraping
Module 11 homework

Overall Comment: This assignment was very instructive and fun to complete. I feel more confident working in Pandas now than when I used it primarily for Project 1 in July last month. Overall, I think web scraping useful skill to obtain data if there is no other available source (API or csv or SQL or other) for data AND it is ethically and legally permitted.
